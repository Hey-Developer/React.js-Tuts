So we clear all the files from our directory which we got by default from create-react-app.
-> But we kept only few files like:
 > public--index.html (which is a base file)
 > src--index.js
 > package.json file 

Now let us re create our index.js file clear all the content of index.js file.

> FOr any react app we need two dependencies which is must these are->
-- React and React DOM
-- So we will start from importing them.
-- and then use a render  method to display our elements or components to the html page.

Now there are two choice.
~ Either u can make a component and then render that component on html page,
~ OR u can directly write a simple tag in the first parameter of render method. (Using JSX or React.createElement())
